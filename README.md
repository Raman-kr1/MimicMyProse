This repository documents my journey to create a personalized AI writing assistant. It contains the data strategy, curation methodology, and code for fine-tuning a language model on my own writing samples (emails, messages, documents) to generate text that mirrors my unique tone, formality, and syntactic style.

*This is a personal project and a work in progress, built in public.*

##  The Motive: Why This Project?

Modern AI writing tools are powerful, but generic. They don't sound like *me*. This project is an experiment to answer a simple question:

**Can I teach an AI to write with my voice?**

The goal isn't to automate my writing entirely, but to create a **stylistic co-pilot** that can:
*   **Draft initial responses** that already sound like me, saving time and mental energy.
*   **Maintain consistency** in my communication style across different platforms.
*   **Adapt to context** instantly, knowing when to be formal with a client or casual with a friend.
*   Serve as a **digital archive** of my personal writing style.

This is the core of personalized AI—moving from one-size-fits-all to a model that understands *you*.
